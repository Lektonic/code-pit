# .local.pit

This file is used to keep track of settings, cache, and other data unique to your copy of the pit repo.

## Cached changes

For example, changes to files and the tree are written to the .local.pit file whenever a `pit add` and similar commands are run.

Once a `pit commit` is run, the local changes are added to the `.code.pit` file.
